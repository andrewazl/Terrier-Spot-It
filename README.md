CS 411 Project: Lost and Found brought into the 21st Century for Boston University

About the course
While the term software engineering covers a broad range of topics, it in general applies to the overall 
process of creating software solutions. It isn’t just about writing code; in fact the implementation of 
software is usually the smaller part of a project. In CS411 we will take a close look at the various phases 
of software projects: Definition; Design; Development; Delivery; Management; and Maintenance. In each phase 
we’ll explore current methodologies and see how the pieces fit together into successful projects. An 
overarching topic will be software quality and how to achieve it by applying specific techniques in each 
project phase. 

After completing CS411 you should be able to understand and use the basic concepts of software engineering 
to plan and execute software projects in any phase. You’ll also be exposed to a variety of tools currently 
used in software projects in industry.
